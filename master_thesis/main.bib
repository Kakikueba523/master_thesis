abstract = {We propose a thick-restart block Lanczos method, which is an extension of the thick-restart Lanczos method with the block algorithm, as an eigensolver of the large-scale shell-model calculations. This method has two advantages over the conventional Lanczos method: the precise computations of the near-degenerate eigenvalues, and the efficient computations for obtaining a large number of eigenvalues. These features are quite advantageous to compute highly excited states where the eigenvalue density is rather high. A shell-model code, named KSHELL, equipped with this method was developed for massively parallel computations, and it enables us to reveal nuclear statistical properties which are intensively investigated by recent experimental facilities. We describe the algorithm and performance of the KSHELL code and demonstrate that the present method outperforms the conventional Lanczos method.
Program summary
Program Title: KSHELL Program Files doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/kgzdz6ryyk.1 Licensing provisions: GPLv3 Programming language: Fortran 90 Nature of problem: The nuclear shell-model calculation is one of the configuration interaction methods in nuclear physics to study nuclear structure. The model space is spanned by the M-scheme basis states. We obtain nuclear wave functions by solving an eigenvalue problem of the shell-model Hamiltonian matrix, which is a sparse, symmetric matrix. Solution method: The KSHELL code enables us to solve the eigenvalue problem of the shell-model Hamiltonian matrix utilizing the thick-restart Lanczos or thick-restart block Lanczos methods. Since the number of the matrix elements are too huge to be stored, the elements are generated on the fly at every matrix–vector product. The overhead of the on-the-fly algorithm are reduced by the block Lanczos method. Additional comments including restrictions and unusual features: The KSHELL code is equipped with a user-friendly dialog interface to generate a shell script to run a job. The program runs both on a single node and a massively parallel computer. It provides us with energy levels, spin, isospin, magnetic and quadrupole moments, E2/M1 transition probabilities and one-particle spectroscopic factors. Up to tens of billions M-scheme dimension is capable, if enough memory is available.}

Experimental data from elastic electron scattering, muonic atom X-rays, Kα isotope shifts, and optical isotope shifts have been taken into account that were available up to January 2004. Wherever possible, connections and constraints between the data were applied to make the data system consistent. Based on the resulting data set, the smooth global structure of the radius surface R(N,Z) was investigated by fitting simple empirical functions to the intersections with constant Z and N as well as with constant A plains. The simple behavior of the surface rendered it possible to apply a simple model, the two-liquid drop model to reproduce the main tendencies, and to predict the existence of a indentation along the line of stability on the radius surface. This indentation suggests a decrease of average nucleon density away from stability. The fine structure in the mass number dependence of rms charge radii is briefly presented.}

title = {POSSIBLE RESONANCES IN THE 12C + 12C FUSION RATE AND SUPERBURST IGNITION},
journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
abstract = {Observationally inferred superburst ignition depths are shallower than models predict. We address this discrepancy by reexamining the superburst trigger mechanism. We first explore the hypothesis of Kuulkers et al. that exothermic electron captures trigger superbursts. We find that all electron capture reactions are thermally stable in accreting neutron star oceans and thus are not a viable trigger mechanism. Fusion reactions other than 12C + 12C are infeasible as well since the possible reactants either deplete at much shallower depths or have prohibitively large Coulomb barriers. Thus, we confirm the proposal of Cumming &amp; Bildsten and Strohmayer &amp; Brown that 12C + 12C triggers superbursts. We then examine the 12C + 12C fusion rate. The reaction cross section is experimentally unknown at astrophysically relevant energies, but resonances exist in the 12C + 12C system throughout the entire measured energy range. Thus it is likely, and in fact has been predicted, that a resonance exists near the Gamow peak energy Epk ≈ 1.5 MeV. For such a hypothetical 1.5 MeV resonance, we derive both a fiducial value and upper limit to the resonance strength (ωγ)R and find that such a resonance could decrease the theoretically predicted superburst ignition depth by up to a factor of 4; in this case, observationally inferred superburst ignition depths would accord with model predictions for a range of plausible neutron star parameters. Said differently, such a resonance would decrease the temperature required for unstable 12C ignition at a column depth 1012 g cm−2 from 6 × 108 K to 5 × 108 K. A resonance at 1.5 MeV would not strongly affect the ignition density of Type Ia supernovae, but it would lower the temperature at which 12C ignites in massive post-main-sequence stars. Determining the existence of a strong resonance in the Gamow window requires measurements of the 12C + 12C cross section down to a center-of-mass energy near 1.5 MeV, which is within reach of the proposed DUSEL facility.}

@article{Bravo2011,
   abstract = {Context. Even if the 12C+12C reaction plays a central role in the ignition of type Ia supernovae (SNIa), the experimental determination of its cross-section at astrophysically relevant energies (E ≲ 2 MeV) has never been made. The profusion of resonances throughout the measured energy range has led to speculation that there is an unknown resonance at E0 ~ 1.5 MeV possibly as strong as the one measured for the resonance at 2.14 MeV, i.e. (ωγ)R = 0.13 meV.Aims. We study the implications that such a resonance would have for our knowledge of the physics of SNIa, paying special attention to the phases that go from the crossing of the ignition curve to the dynamical event.Methods. We use one-dimensional hydrostatic and hydrodynamic codes to follow the evolution of accreting white dwarfs until they grow close to the Chandrasekhar mass and explode as SNIa. In our simulations, we account for a low-energy resonance by exploring the parameter space allowed by experimental data.Results. A change in the 12C+12C rate similar to the one explored here would have profound consequences for the physical conditions in the SNIa explosion, namely the central density, neutronization, thermal profile, mass of the convective core, location of the runaway hot spot, or time elapsed since crossing the ignition curve. For instance, with the largest resonance strength we use, the time elapsed since crossing the ignition curve to the supernova event is shorter by a factor ten than for models using the standard rate of 12C+12C, and the runaway temperature is reduced from  ~8.14 × 108 K to  ~ 4.26 × 108 K. On the other hand, a resonance at 1.5 MeV, with a strength ten thousand times smaller than the one measured at 2.14 MeV, but with an α/p yield ratio substantially different from 1 would have a sizeable impact on the degree of neutronization of matter during carbon simmering.Conclusions. A robust understanding of the links between SNIa properties and their progenitors will not be attained until the 12C+12C reaction rate is measured at energies  ~1.5 MeV.},

    abstract = {Over the last 40 years, the 12C +12C fusion reaction has been the subject of considerable experimental efforts to constrain uncertainties at temperatures relevant for stellar nucleosynthesis. Recent studies have indicated that the reaction rate may be higher than that currently used in stellar models. In order to investigate the effect of an enhanced carbon-burning rate on massive star structure and nucleosynthesis, new stellar evolution models and their yields are presented exploring the impact of three different 12C +12C reaction rates. Non-rotating stellar models considering five different initial masses, 15, 20, 25, 32 and 60 M⊙, at solar metallicity, were generated using the Geneva Stellar Evolution Code (genec) and were later post-processed with the NuGrid Multi-zone Post-Processing Network tool (mppnp). A dynamic nuclear reaction network of ∼1100 isotopes was used to track the s-process nucleosynthesis. An enhanced 12C +12C reaction rate causes core carbon burning to be ignited more promptly and at lower temperature. This reduces the neutrino losses, which increases the core carbon-burning lifetime. An increased carbon-burning rate also increases the upper initial mass limit for which a star exhibits a convective carbon core (rather than a radiative one). Carbon-shell burning is also affected, with fewer convective-shell episodes and convection zones that tend to be larger in mass. Consequently, the chance of an overlap between the ashes of carbon-core burning and the following carbon shell convection zones is increased, which can cause a portion of the ashes of carbon-core burning to be included in the carbon shell. Therefore, during the supernova explosion, the ejecta will be enriched by s-process nuclides synthesized from the carbon-core s-process. The yields were used to estimate the weak s-process component in order to compare with the Solar system abundance distribution. The enhanced rate models were found to produce a significant proportion of Kr, Sr, Y, Zr, Mo, Ru, Pd and Cd in the weak component, which is primarily the signature of the carbon-core s-process. Consequently, it is shown that the production of isotopes in the Kr–Sr region can be used to constrain the 12C +12C rate using the current branching ratio for α- and p-exit channels.},

There are good reasons to believe that perhaps most type Ia supernovae are the explosions of white dwarfs that have approached the Chandrasekhar mass, , and are disrupted by thermonuclear fusion of carbon and oxygen. However, the mechanism whereby such accreting carbon-oxygen white dwarfs explode continues to be uncertain. Recent progress in modeling type Ia supernovae as well as several of the still open questions are addressed in this review. Although the main emphasis is on studies of the explosion mechanism itself and on the related physical processes, including the physics of turbulent nuclear combustion in degenerate stars, we also discuss observational constraints.",

abstract = {We use an underground counting lab with an extremely low background to perform an activity measurement for the C12+13C system with energies down to Ec.m.=2.323 MeV, at which the 12C(13C,p)24Na cross section is found to be 0.22(7) nb. The C12+13C fusion cross section is derived with a statistical model calibrated using experimental data. Our new result of the C12+13C fusion cross section is the first decisive evidence in the carbon isotope systems which rules out the existence of the astrophysical S-factor maximum predicted by the phenomenological hindrance model, while confirming the rising trend of the S-factor towards lower energies predicted by other models, such as CC-M3Y+Rep, DC-TDHF, KNS, SPP and ESW. After normalizing the model predictions with our data, a more reliable upper limit is established for the C12+12C fusion cross sections at stellar energies.}

abstract = {The 12C + 12C fusion cross section has been studied over the energy range 2.46 ≦ Ec.m. ≦ 5.88 MeV. The yields of the γ-rays emitted from the first excited states of 23Na and 20Ne, following 24Mg compound nucleus decay via proton- and α-emissions, were measured using a Ge(Li) detector. The fusion cross section was obtained by normalizing these yields to previously reported 12C(12C, p)23Na and 12C(12C, α)20Ne cross sections. The data indicate that the cross section below 3.5 MeV is dominated by two or more resonances, and that the average trend in this energy region does not show the absorption-under-the barrier features of the optical model. For astrophysical extrapolations to lower energies, the new results are consistent with the extrapolation proposed by Fowler, Caughlan and Zimmerman.}
