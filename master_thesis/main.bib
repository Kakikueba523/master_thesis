Our method is a stochastic estimation of eigenvalue count based on a shifted Krylov-subspace method, which enables us to obtain level densities of huge Hamiltonian matrices. This framework leads to a successful description of both low-lying spectroscopy and the experimentally observed equilibration of Jπ=2+ and 2- states in 58Ni in a unified manner.},

abstract = {We propose a thick-restart block Lanczos method, which is an extension of the thick-restart Lanczos method with the block algorithm, as an eigensolver of the large-scale shell-model calculations. This method has two advantages over the conventional Lanczos method: the precise computations of the near-degenerate eigenvalues, and the efficient computations for obtaining a large number of eigenvalues. These features are quite advantageous to compute highly excited states where the eigenvalue density is rather high. A shell-model code, named KSHELL, equipped with this method was developed for massively parallel computations, and it enables us to reveal nuclear statistical properties which are intensively investigated by recent experimental facilities. We describe the algorithm and performance of the KSHELL code and demonstrate that the present method outperforms the conventional Lanczos method.
Program summary
Program Title: KSHELL Program Files doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/kgzdz6ryyk.1 Licensing provisions: GPLv3 Programming language: Fortran 90 Nature of problem: The nuclear shell-model calculation is one of the configuration interaction methods in nuclear physics to study nuclear structure. The model space is spanned by the M-scheme basis states. We obtain nuclear wave functions by solving an eigenvalue problem of the shell-model Hamiltonian matrix, which is a sparse, symmetric matrix. Solution method: The KSHELL code enables us to solve the eigenvalue problem of the shell-model Hamiltonian matrix utilizing the thick-restart Lanczos or thick-restart block Lanczos methods. Since the number of the matrix elements are too huge to be stored, the elements are generated on the fly at every matrix–vector product. The overhead of the on-the-fly algorithm are reduced by the block Lanczos method. Additional comments including restrictions and unusual features: The KSHELL code is equipped with a user-friendly dialog interface to generate a shell script to run a job. The program runs both on a single node and a massively parallel computer. It provides us with energy levels, spin, isospin, magnetic and quadrupole moments, E2/M1 transition probabilities and one-particle spectroscopic factors. Up to tens of billions M-scheme dimension is capable, if enough memory is available.}

Parameters obtained by a model-independent analysis are given in two additional tables: Table IV gives the coefficients of a Fourier-Bessel series expansion, and Table V gives the positions and amplitudes for the expansion in a sum of gaussians.

abstract = {A set of 799 ground state nuclear charge radii is presented. Experimental data from elastic electron scattering, muonic atom X-rays, Kα isotope shifts, and optical isotope shifts have been taken into account that were available up to January 2004. Wherever possible, connections and constraints between the data were applied to make the data system consistent. Based on the resulting data set, the smooth global structure of the radius surface R(N,Z) was investigated by fitting simple empirical functions to the intersections with constant Z and N as well as with constant A plains. The simple behavior of the surface rendered it possible to apply a simple model, the two-liquid drop model to reproduce the main tendencies, and to predict the existence of a indentation along the line of stability on the radius surface. This indentation suggests a decrease of average nucleon density away from stability. The fine structure in the mass number dependence of rms charge radii is briefly presented.}
